**Here's what it should look like:**

![Sushi Saga](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/React-Practice-Code-Challenge/master/sushi-saga-demo.gif)

**Doesn't that look delicious?!**

The component hierarchy should be as follows:

- `App` is parent to both `SushiContainer` and `Table`
- `SushiContainer` is parent to both `Sushi` and `MoreButton`

Be sure to read all of the notes in the all of the components before getting started! They will give you clues as to how and where to manage `state` and `props`

### Bonus!

1. SushiWallet! Add a form for customers to add more money to their balance
2. Full rotation! When the end of the line of sushi is reached, the conveyor belt should start from the beginning. Sushi that have already been eaten should remain eaten. It would be creepy if they reappeared!
3. Anything else!

**Note:** If at the end of the challenge you have achieved all the functionality required but the style looks off, this is okay!
